WARNING: THIS CODE IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND HAS NEVER BEEN TESTED IN THE
FIELD. DO NOT ASSUME THE RESULTS ARE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE. DO NOT USE IN
ANY SITUATION WHERE LIFE, SAFETY OR PROPERTY DEPEND ON THE OUTPUT.

This is an example program that shows an approach to calibrating a
three-axis digital magnetometer, then using the calibration data to
convert readings to compass headings.

This is free software. See COPYING for details.

Note that this example is intentionally a naive implementation, meant
as a proof-of-concept that does the simplest thing that can possibly work.
There are any number of obvious (and non-obvious) optimizations that can
be made.

Also note that there are quite a few magic constants lurking in
calibrate.c. All of these are wild guesses, and no particular effort
has been made to optimize them.

To build, run "make" as a normal user.

To run, you'll need a Raspberry Pi with an HMC5883L magnetometer connected
to the I2C bus. (The code should be easily adaptable to other platforms,
though the hmc5883l.c module is somewhat specific to that sensor.)

Start with your vehicle/platform/whatever facing georgraphic North, then
launch the program. You will need to run it as root (or otherwise arrange
for user-level access to the I2C bus).

When instructed, turn the sensor slowly clockwise. (It helps if you have
a stable platform like a turntable, lazy susan or swivel office chair.)

Once you've made a full circle, you should see output like:

This should be followed by a continuously-updated heading (in degrees
to the right of geographic North).
